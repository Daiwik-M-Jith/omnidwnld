Release Title: v1.0.0 — Background Downloads, SSE Progress, Worker Scaffold
Tag: v1.0.0
Date: 2025-11-18

Short summary:
OmniDwnld v1.0.0 introduces a robust background-download architecture, realtime progress
reporting, and a production-oriented worker scaffold. This release stabilizes the UI, adds
clear user guidance, and provides the building blocks needed to run heavy processing outside
of serverless environments.

Highlights:
- Realtime progress: SSE-based progress streaming for downloads so the UI shows accurate
  percentage, speed and ETA.
- Background worker scaffold: Added a BullMQ + Redis worker (in `worker/`) that runs
  yt-dlp, handles ffmpeg remux/re-encode fallbacks, and uploads artifacts to S3. Includes
  `Dockerfile`, `index.js`, and a `worker/README.md`.
- Robust downloader logic: Server-side improvements include yt-dlp invocation, remux-with-copy-first
  and re-encode fallback via `ffmpeg-static`.
- UI improvements: Neon warning in the hero and explanatory footnote clarifying that some
  files may download as `.webm` and how to convert/rename them.
- Docs & governance: Polished `README.md`, added `LICENSE` (MIT) and `SECURITY.md`.
- Project ready for hybrid deployment: Guidance and scaffolding to run frontend on Vercel
  while offloading heavy downloads to the worker.

Files added / changed (high level):
- Added/modified: `app/page.tsx` (UI notice/footnote)
- Added: `LICENSE` (MIT)
- Replaced: `README.md` (polished, deployment-ready)
- Added: `SECURITY.md` (responsible disclosure)
- Added worker scaffold: `worker/index.js`, `worker/package.json`, `worker/Dockerfile`,
  `worker/README.md`

Usage & quick start:
- Run frontend locally:
  1) Install deps and run dev:
     npm install
     npm run dev

- Run worker (development):
  From `worker/`:
     cd worker
     npm install
     REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379 S3_BUCKET=your-bucket AWS_REGION=us-east-1 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... npm run start

- Build for production:
     npm run build

Important deployment notes:
- Vercel is suitable for the frontend, but:
  - Do NOT run heavy ffmpeg/yt-dlp work in Vercel serverless functions — use the included worker instead.
  - Replace local SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) with a managed DB (Postgres) for production scale.
  - Use object storage (S3) for artifacts — serverless filesystem is ephemeral.
- Worker communicates progress via Redis pub/sub (`progress:<jobId>`). Implement a server-side bridge
  to forward updates to clients (SSE or WebSocket), or adapt the Next.js API to read progress from Redis.

Upgrade / migration notes:
- If you were using the previous in-memory job system, migrate to enqueue jobs into Redis/BullMQ:
  - Add Redis connection string `REDIS_URL`.
  - Enqueue jobs with payload: `{ url, format, jobId, s3Bucket, targetExt }`.
  - Run the worker to perform downloads and uploads.

Known issues & caveats:
- Some ffmpeg builds may lack certain encoders (libx264/aac). If re-encode fails, install/point to
  an ffmpeg build with required codecs.
- The release intentionally provides scaffolding; production hardening (retry policies, auth, metrics,
  logging, rate-limits) is still required before commercial use.

Security & compliance:
- `SECURITY.md` added with responsible disclosure guidance — replace the placeholder contact email with a
  real contact before public launch.
- Project licensed under MIT.

Suggested next steps:
- Add a Redis-to-SSE bridge in the Next.js server so the UI receives worker progress.
- Migrate SQLite -> Postgres (e.g., Supabase / PlanetScale).
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run `npm run build` and `npm run lint` on PRs.
- Add monitoring, retries, authentication, and rate-limiting for production readiness.
