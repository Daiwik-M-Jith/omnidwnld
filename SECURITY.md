# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep OmniDwnld secure. This document explains how to report security vulnerabilities and what to expect from our team.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Prefer private disclosure: open an email to `security@omnidwnld.local` (replace with a real contact) with details.
- If email is not available, open a private GitHub issue and mark it `security` or contact the repository owner directly.

When reporting, please include:

- A short description of the issue
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions or a minimal proof-of-concept
- The impact and any remediation suggestions
- Your contact information (email)

Do NOT include exploit code in a public issue or discussions. If you must share POC code, provide it securely via email or an encrypted channel.

## What We Will Do

1. Acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
2. Triage and assess severity.
3. Work with the reporter to validate and fix the issue.
4. Publish a coordinated disclosure (security advisory) after a fix is released, unless the reporter requests otherwise.

## Disclosure Timeline

- We aim to resolve critical issues within 30 days when possible.
- For issues requiring coordinated disclosure with third parties, timelines may vary.

## Reporting Sensitive Data

If you believe you have discovered leaked credentials, private user data, or other sensitive information, please provide specifics and any evidence securely — do not publish sensitive data in public channels.

## PGP Key

If you prefer encrypted communication, please request our PGP public key via the contact email above.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters who consent to being acknowledged in release notes or advisories.

If you are a security researcher and need faster contact, include "URGENT: security" in the subject line.

Thank you for helping keep OmniDwnld safe.
